        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Collaborated on a cross-functional team that deployed a stock volatility XGBoost regression based on geospatial tariff ratios to assess market impacts of recent trade policies and monitor risk potential onto the supply chain. 
        \item Saved \$250,000 annually by implementing an end-to-end Python automation system with LLM integration that generated risk reports, integrating both Azure and AWS infrastructure to redirect 100+ researchers.
        \item Developed a RAG model using Docker with ChatGPT and LangChain integrated with a ChromaDB vector database, leveraging Databricks and AWS S3, EC2, ECS, and Lambda to process unstructured data at scale.
        \item Helped build an interpretable MLOps pipeline using Spark and Kubernetes to predict the financial health of 50,000+ global entities by analyzing trade and geospatial risk indicators in a Random Forest classifier.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Data Science Intern} | \textit{Exiger} | \textit{McLean, VA} \hfill May 2024 - August 2024\\
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Constructed a standardized prefix/suffix classification system separated by character type and language from a dataset of 10M international company names, improving entity fuzzy matching by 30\% in A/B testing.
        \item Implemented an address standardization tool with ArcGIS API that enhanced supply chain origin identification and classification through Bayesian testing, resulting in a 21\% reduction in geocoding errors.
